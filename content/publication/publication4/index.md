abstract: "The optimal rapid expansion randomized tree(RRT*)is an asymptotically optimal path planning method for mobile robots.Quick-RRT*reduces the initial path length of RRT*and increases the path convergence speed.In order to further improve the convergence speed of Quick-RRT*,this paper proposed a dual-tree Quick-RRT*(Quick-RRT*-Connect)algorithm.Firstly,two random trees were generated at the start and end points respectively based on the Quick-RRT*algorithm.Two trees grew in turn and they were connected with greedy method.Then,the probability completeness and asymptotic optimality of the proposed algorithm were analyzed and testified.Finally,based on the Matlab platform,Quick-RRT*-Connect was compared with RRT*,Quick-RRT*and RRT*-Connect in three environments.The results show that the improved algorithm can not only find initial path and suboptimal path in a shorter time,but also reduce the initial path length."
