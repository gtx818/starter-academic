abstract: "In this paper, we design a hexapod climbing robot and propose a cross-plane transition gait algorithm to solve the problem that the general walking robot can't perform the work at high altitude and can't realize the autonomous transition between multiple planes. Firstly, we build a simulation control system based on MATLAB and V-REP for algorithm analysis and motion verification. Meanwhile, virtual connection technology is used to design virtual suction sensor to simulate the real adhesion mechanisms. Then, the single-plane walking gait algorithm is designed based on the SS-Shaped interpolation function, which effectively avoid the wear of the adhesion mechanisms. The transition algorithm based on workspace constraints is designed to greatly improve the adaptability of robots in complex environments. Finally, the simulation of rhythmic gait motion and ground-slope transitional motion verify the effectiveness of the gait planning method."
