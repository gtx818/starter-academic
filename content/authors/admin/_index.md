Greetings! My name is Gao Tianxiao. I am currently pursuing the Master of Engineering degree in the Control Science and Engineering program at South China University of Technology and anctipate completing it by next summer. Previously, I obtained the Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electrical Engineering and its Automation from Beijing Forestry University. My research focuses on computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, I am deeply intrested in solving the dynamic problem in visual SLAM with the help of deep learning method and improving the network predictions drawing support from the geometric information from visual SLAM.
